# hangmanPython

In this project, I created a basic hangman game in python. The game includes 3 different categories that are chosen randomly.
Like a normal hangman game, you get 6 lives to guess the word, or you lose. 

This was made using lists and their functions, while loops, if-else statements, and the random package
